### Blocksi Enterprise Edition Bypass
This bypass works by disabling all Chrome extensions to stop Blocksi from loading.  
Since MOE has made a script to stop regular Chrome from starting with extensions, the script now makes a copy of the Chrome Program Files to circumvent this.   
<a href="Byp4.vbs" download><p>Download Byp4.vbs</p></a>

The script below can be used to automatically delete the files generated by Byp4.
<a href="UnByp4.vbs" download><p>Download UnByp4.vbs</p></a>

*The script's code has been redacted so as to prevent this page from being blocked. You may still review the code by opening the downloaded files in Notepad.*
